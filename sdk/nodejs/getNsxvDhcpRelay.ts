/**
 * Provides a VMware Cloud Director Edge Gateway DHCP relay configuration data source. The DHCP relay
 * capability provided by NSX in VMware Cloud Director environment allows to leverage existing DHCP
 * infrastructure from within VMware Cloud Director environment without any interruption to the IP address
 * management in existing DHCP infrastructure. DHCP messages are relayed from virtual machines to the
 * designated DHCP servers in your physical DHCP infrastructure, which allows IP addresses controlled
 * by the NSX software to continue to be in sync with IP addresses in the rest of your DHCP-controlled
 * environments.
 *
 * Supported in provider *v2.6+*
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### 1
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vcd from "@pulumi/vcd";
 *
 * const relayConfig = vcd.getNsxvDhcpRelay({
 *     org: "my-org",
 *     vdc: "my-org-vdc",
 *     edgeGateway: "my-edge-gw",
